# PTS-eJPT-review

In the beginning of 2021, I embarked on my journey with limited knowledge in the realm of hacking and penetration testing. However, I did possess a foundation in computer building and certain aspects of networking. Prior to delving into the PTP/eJPT certification, I had enrolled in David Bombal's free CCNA course, which I completed approximately 10% of. This course provided insights into networking fundamentals, including network architecture, subnetting, binary and hex coding, as well as TCP/IP and UDP protocols. During the summer of 2021, TryHackMe introduced a pre-security path, which significantly contributed to my understanding of the field.

My preparation for the eJPT certification was thorough and involved training across four distinct platforms. I extensively utilized TryHackMe, HackTheBox, the eLearnSecurity PTS course, and The Cyber Mentor's Practical Ethical Hacking (PEH) course. I highly recommend starting with TryHackMe's pre-security and complete beginner paths, progressing through the entire PTS course. For those who prefer video-based learning, The Cyber Mentor offers excellent instruction in pentesting techniques. While coding skills are not mandatory, a grasp of the basics and their functionality is beneficial.

For those interested in replicating my training path, I completed 98% of the PTS course, tackled HackTheBox retired machines such as Lame, Legacy, Devel, Bashed, and Blue. I achieved an 89% completion rate in the Complete Beginner path and covered approximately 55% of The Cyber Mentor's Practical Ethical Hacker course.

In May 2021, I purchased the eJPT exam and had three days to answer 20 questions. Despite an initial failure, I dedicated myself to addressing my shortcomings and successfully passed on my second attempt, which occurred on May 14th.

Would I recommend this certification to others? Absolutely, especially for those aspiring to enter the field of cybersecurity. It equips individuals with skills relevant to both red and blue team roles.

What sparked my interest in cybersecurity? NetworkChuck played a significant role, as his engaging content fueled my enthusiasm. I completed all of his hacking challenges.

If I could change anything about my journey, I would have discovered TryHackMe earlier.

What are my plans after achieving the eJPT certification? I intend to continue my growth as a pentester. Currently, I am enrolled in the PNPT course, supporting Heath Adams' mission to make practical and affordable testing accessible.
