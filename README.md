Starting out in 2021 I had little knowledge about the art of hacking/pentesting, but I did have the understanding of building computers and some parts of networking. Before studying for the pts/eJPT I was taking the ccna course that David Bombal offered for free in December of 2020, and finished about 10% of the course that I have learned about how a network works, subnetting, binary, hex code, tcp/ip and udp. As of summer of 2021 tryhackme has a pre security path, its gives a good understanding of that. 

My training for the eJPT was a bit long it the aspect I was training on 4 platforms to learn from. Going through tryhackme, hackthebox, pts, and the peh from thecybermentor. My recommendation of the completion to take the eJPT would now be start with the pre security and complete beginner on tryhackme and go through all of the pts, but if u want to have more videos to listen to i do recommend watching the cyber mentor, he's really great on teaching the pentesting role. Do you really need to know coding? No, but I do say learn some of the basic and how it works.

If you really want to do the same training i went through, was pts was at 98% of the course complete, since I had hackthebox retired machines I did lame, legacy, devel, bashed and blue. The Complete Beginner I have completed about 89% of the course. I have only did about 55% of the practical ethical hacker from the cyber mentor.

In May of 2021 I bought the exam to take the test. On the 7th I had 3 days to answer 20 questions. After trying to answer the questions I failed my first attempt. So I got on a grind to help with to problem I was having. After that I gave it a go for my 2nd attempt, and passed it after 9 hours into the exam on the 14th of May, passed.

Would you recommend this to other people? Yes, if your looking into getting into cyber security. It teaches you the skills for both red and blue teaming.

What got you into cyber security? I would say networkchuck, he does some great content that can really hype you up. I did go through all his hacking challenges, that he did.

If you could do anything different what would it be? I wished I would of found tryhackme earlier. 

What's your plans after the eJPT? Well, study and grow as a pentester. Currently I'm in-roled in taking the PNPT, I support Heath Adams goal in making test practical and affordable.
